# TODO! Desktop

You can download [here](https://github.com/yungshenglu/TODO-Desktop/releases)! :tada:

This repository is my practice to implement a simple TODO-list with Vue/Vuex into desktop using Electron. For now, we have a Beta version (v0.1.0) that enables users to add, remove, edit, and check your items in the TODO-list. Besides, we also provide a very simple classification for the status of each item (i.e, todo, done)

> **HINT:** If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
